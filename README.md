# Tennis Stats Analysis

A small repository for my Jupyter notebooks centered around tennis statistics.
All data comes from the amazing work found here:
https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp

## Installation
Matches data is supposed to be found in the project folder, under 'tennis_atp' (a simple clone
of the above repository). 

Used with virtualenv.

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```
